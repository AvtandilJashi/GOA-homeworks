<p><b><em><u>The nation of Georgia was first unified as a kingdom under the Bagrationi dynasty by the King Bagrat 
    III of Georgia in the early 11th century, arising from several predecessor states of the ancient kingdoms 
    of Colchis and Iberia. The Kingdom of Georgia flourished during the 10th to 12th centuries under King David IV the Builder and Queen 
    Tamar the Great, and fell to the Mongol invasion by 1243, and after a brief reunion under George V the Brilliant to the Timurid Empire. By 1490,
     Georgia was fragmented into several petty kingdoms and principalities, which throughout the Early 
    Modern period struggled to maintain their autonomy against Ottoman and Iranian domination until Georgia was
     finally annexed by the Russian Empire in the 19th century. After a brief period of independence as 
    Democratic Republic of Georgia, the country soon ended up being a Soviet Republic until the 
    dissolution of the Soviet Union. The current republic of Georgia has been independent since 1991.</u></em></b> </p>

<p><b><em><u>for the earliest occupation of the territory of present-day Georgia goes back to c. 1.8 million years ago,
 as evident from the excavations of Dmanisi in the southeastern part of the country. 
This is the oldest evidence of humans anywhere in the world outside Africa. Later prehistoric remains 
(Acheulian, Mousterian, and the Upper Palaeolithic) are known from numerous cave and open-air sites in Georgia. The 
earliest agricultural Neolithic occupation dates between 6000 and 5000 BC.
[3][4][5] known as the Shulaveri-Shomu culture, where people 
used local obsidian for tools, raised animals such as cattle and pigs, and grew crops, including grapes.[6]
Numerous excavations in tell settlements of the Shulaveri-Shomu type have been conducted since the 1960s.[3]
Early metallurgy started in Georgia during the 6th millennium BC, associated with the Shulaveri-Shomu culture. From the beginning 
of the 4th millennium, metals became 
used to a larger extent in East Georgia and the whole Transcaucasian region.[7]
Kingdom of Diauehi.
Diauehi, a tribal union of early-Georgians, first appear in written history in the 12th century BC.[8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] 
Archaeological finds and references in 
ancient sources reveal elements of early political and state formations characterized by 
advanced metallurgy and goldsmith techniques that date back to the 7th century BC and beyond.[15] Between 2100 and 750 BC, the area survived the 
invasions by the Hittites, Urartians, Medes, Proto-Persians and Cimmerians. During the 
same period, the ethnic unity of Proto-Kartvelians broke up 
into several branches, among them Svans, Zans/Chans, and East-Kartvelians. 
That finally led to the formation of modern Kartvelian languages: Georgian (originating from East Kartvelian vernaculars), 
Svan, Megrelian and Laz (the latter two originating from Zan dialects). By that 
time Svans were dominant in modern Svaneti and Abkhazia, 
Zans inhabited the modern Georgian province of Samegrelo, while East-Kartvelians formed the majority in modern eastern Georgia. 
As a result of cultural and geographic delimitation, two core areas of future Georgian culture and statehood 
formed in western and eastern Georgia by the end of the 8th century BC. The first two Ge
orgian states emerged in the west known as the Kingdom of Colchis and in the east 
the Kingdom of Iberia.</u></em></p></b>
